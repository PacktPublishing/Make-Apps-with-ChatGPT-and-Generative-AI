Environment Canada has upped its estimated snowfall totals for eastern Newfoundland, saying a messy mix of winter weather could bring as much as 60 centimetres to the Avalon Peninsula.
The snow started falling Friday night and eased Saturday morning. Eighteen centimetres was reported at St. John's International Airport as of 6:30 a.m. Saturday, according to Environment Canada Meteorologist Rodney Barney.
 But the snowfall is expected to be at its heaviest Saturday afternoon and evening and will continue into Sunday.
"We are going to see that heavier snow really develop as we go through the day today," Barney told CBC Radio on Saturday.
"Starting around the lunch hour and continuing through the afternoon into the evening, that's when we're going to be seeing some of the heaviest snowfall rates ... anywhere from two to four centimetres an hour."
The amount of snow will vary depending on elevation, according to a winter storm warning in effect from Environment Canada, but St. John's and the surrounding area could see between 30 and 60 centimetres of snow.
Northern and southern parts of the Avalon, along with the Bonavista Peninsula, could see between 20 and 35 centimetres of snow.
